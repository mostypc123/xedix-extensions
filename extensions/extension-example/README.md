## The Example XediX Extension
This is a exmple extension, which prints "Hello World" when running XediX.

### Documentation
This does not really needs some docs, but it is important to note that there is only the extension_mainclass.py file, but you can put the code in any of these files, but for simple extensions like this, itÂ´s best to use the extension_mainfn.py file, but it does not matter at all.
